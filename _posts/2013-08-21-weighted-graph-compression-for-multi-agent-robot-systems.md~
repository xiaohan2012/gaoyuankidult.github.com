Hannu Toivonen and his partners introduced their researches in the paper
“Compression of Weighted Graphs”. Motivated by graph problems which contain
large amount of vertices, the authors formalize problems of weighted graph 
mathematically and then propose several algorithms to deal with graph compression. 
According to the paper, the compression algorithms of weighted graph have been 
widely used in the social analysis and biological analysis. By considering the 
properties of the compression algorithms of weighted graphs, I would like to suggest 
that these algorithms have a possibility of being applied in multi-agent systems in 
robotics, because these algorithms can enable multi-agent systems to be power-saving, 
system-wide efficient and applicable on today’s robot devices.

This feature of reducing the vertices of a weighted graph contributes to 
reducing computational power under certain robot path-planning environments, for 
example, when robots want to mainly use its power to process a large image.
Normally, the path-planning algorithms require building a rapidly exploring random 
tree which contains a randomized graph. For precise path-planning algorithms, nodes 
are connected with weighted graph in which a large set of vertices is included.
Although this huge amount of vertices may lead to a precise and smooth planning 
result, actually sometimes it may also cause the algorithms to use out of all the 
computational resources. By providing a stable algorithm of compressing weighted 
graph, the path-planning algorithms can reduce total amount of its vertices. This 
ability can enable the searching process in path-planning algorithms to focus on
finding a valid path first rather than trying to make any precise prediction at the 
beginning.

The power of the compression algorithms of weighted graph does not only 
show its power on reducing computational power under certain situations, it also 
provides a way of system-wide efficient planning. In a multi-agent robot system, each 
robot can be considered as a node in a graph. In many cases, these robots may defend, 
offend or walk together. When several robots need to achieve the same goal, subgraphs made of these robots can be compressed. This mechanism can enable multiagent systems to ignore the internal cooperation of robots in the analysis phase and,
however, pay more attention on system-wide planning. For example the soccer robots 
which cooperate to defend the soccer goal can be considered as one defending object
while making a possible overall strategy.

In addition to power-saving feature and system-wide efficiency, the 
applicability provided by the weighted graph compression algorithms is another 
advantage. The optimization of path-planning algorithms in robot system has always 
been a challenging problem. Although there are several ways of optimizing the 
quality of the different algorithms including the evolutionary algorithm, statistical
learning algorithm, unfortunately each of these algorithms requires a lot of processing 
time. The robot systems are normally built using embedded systems which only 
contain limited memory. The weighted graph compression algorithm themselves, 
however, do not require much computational resources. As a result, it is possible to 
use compression algorithms to optimize other algorithms on modern robotic devices. 
By cutting or combining vertices, the compression algorithms can dramatically 
increase the flexibility of robots and also generate convenience to the whole system
structure. 

Power-saving feature, system-wide efficiency and applicability are the three 
things that weighed graph compression algorithms could contribute to modern multiagent robot system. By carefully examining these three merits, applying the weighted 
graph compression algorithms in multi-agent systems is worth trying. It can be a great 
research direction for the further study.
